# drag-and-drop-builder
drag and drop builder is an innovative free website creator.

# drag and drop mechanic
using drag and drop you can create and manage, and download completed websites, where as popular drag and drop services don't allow full ownership or downloading of the user's website.

# github pages integration
through Google firebase, drag and drop provides the log in with github feature, where you can create your websites and then push it to a repo through the site. 

# load previous projects 
when you use this tool you can load your site and edit it again, allowing for updates and edits. You can also load repos that were made without this tool, but it's not as stable. 

# payment management 
this site uses PayPal integration for handling payments, which makes the site look and feel very secure

# beating the standard 
most drag and drop websites require a monthly service to use them, you can't download your site or host it on a different platform, your restricted to that tool, but with drag-and-drop-builder you aren't restricted at all, your allowed to download and edit all of your code, in fact everything is public and easy to access because your site is hosted on a public repo.
